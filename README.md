This Node.js application demonstrates a basic web server using the Express.js framework. Upon launching the server, visiting http://localhost:3000
 in a browser renders a simple "Hello World!" message. This confirms that the server is running successfully and responding to HTTP GET requests on the root ("/") route. The goal of this experiment is to familiarize beginners with setting up a Node.js environment, using Express for routing, and serving responses to client requests through a minimal RESTful interface.
